### TODO
1. Add a way to remove any text decorations such as bold and red color
2. Add `inputParser()` to object constructor
3. Try using `validateattributes()` for setters and constructor
4. See if file closure does not happen every log, but in object destructor
5. Message input as `sprintf()` format, instead of having to format before hand
6. Add option to specify which par-for process workers is logging (id = labindex)
7. Add "TRACE" level before "DEBUG"

### FIXME

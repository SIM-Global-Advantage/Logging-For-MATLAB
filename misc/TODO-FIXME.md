### TODO
1. Add `inputParser()` to object constructor
2. Try using `validateattributes()` for setters and constructor
3. See if file closure does not happen every log, but in object destructor
4. Message input as `sprintf()` format, instead of having to format before hand
5. Add option to specify which par-for process workers is logging (id = labindex)

### FIXME
1. ... pff.. i am sure there is a bug lurking in the dark ...

### Wish List
Some things I would love to have added to this logger

1. Write to file in batches instead of line by line
2. Seperate message formatting for command window and file
3. Remote server or location logging
4. Integrate with remote logging services
5. Simple DAQ option
   * logger.daq_init()             - filename, precision formatting, delimiter, show_headers
   * logger.daq(<float data>)      - Log the float type data (or some
   * Store in seperate file (.csv file)

   * Time stamp and data (absoulute time, a)
   * Needs headers (with ID int as first column)
   * Store in logger
